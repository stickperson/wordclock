DXF files cannot be edited in Inkscape directly. Open the svg and make your edits. When done, select all and choose Path -> Combine. Then Object -> Group. Finally, File -> Save a
Copy and save it as a dxf. If the image appears odd in the dxf or is missing details, try making sure nothing is selected when you create the dxf. If it's messed up, go back to the
svg and try Object -> Ungroup followed by Path -> Break Apart.
