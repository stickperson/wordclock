# Arduino Code
This code is a decent starting point for running using an Arduino. It's very, very messy because I hacked it together quickly, but hey, it works. Depending on how you wire up your LED strips, you may need to change the LED definitions for words. It looks like in this example the very first LED was in the top right corner, so the first row went R -> L, then L -> R, so on and so forth.

Any external libraries are included in `libraries.gz`. Also, I have no idea how C/C++ works so there's probably a much better way to do all of this.
